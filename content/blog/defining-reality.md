title: Defining Reality
description: Why is reality so difficult to describe?
---
At the most general level reality is easiest to define as *[the quality or state of being real](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reality)*. Reality is neither [*fantasy, fiction* nor *illusion*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/reality).

Trying to get beyond the general definition is tricky. Despite a wealth of knowledge there are limits to what is known. As a result people often disagree about what is real. Even experts disagree.

The difficulty in talking about reality is exemplified by a conversation I had with a dental hygienist years ago. Maybe my first mistake was trying to make Einstein's Theory of Relativity a topic of idle conversation. I described the idea that the speed of light was the universal constant whereas every other measurement is relative. The hygienist thought about what I said, and remarked that the true universal constant is God. 

Getting answers like that isn't entirely surprising when you live in the Bible Belt. The clash of sacred and secular knowledge happens when two systems of ideas share a word like reality. Entangled in the question of reality are moral and ethical judgments. Discussions about reality can get heated very quickly.

Even if we limit our discussion of reality to secular or scientific knowledge, experts in their fields will often disagree. Historically, the debate between Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein about quantum mechanics being a field of probability and randomness is telling. When Bohr's student Werner Heisenberg's discovered his [Uncertainty Principle](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-uncertainty/), Einstein quipped that *[God does not play dice with the Universe](https://www.businessinsider.com/god-does-not-play-dice-quote-meaning-2015-11)*. Despite quantum mechanics being one of the most successful scientific discoveries Einstein was bothered by the idea that reality could be left to chance (to be sure Einstein contributed greatly to the field of quantum mechanics).\

Part of what makes discussions about reality so compelling is that despite seeming basic, intuitive and fundamental reality is difficult to define.
