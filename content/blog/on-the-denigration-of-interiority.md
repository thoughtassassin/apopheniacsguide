title: On the Denigration of Interiority
description: How did feelings become a dirty word?

What exists?

That is the central question in our discussion of reality.

To be able to examine this question we rely upon how we experience that which exists. The role of the observer is essential to understanding fundamental laws of nature such as quantum mechanics and relativity. The state of particles depends upon the role of the observer. Speed and motion depends upon the role of the observer.

I bring this up to bring you a strangely hopeful message. Your role in the universe matters. Your effect is scientifically quantifiable. Each movement that you make sends ripples throughout the universe.

I lapse into this emotional plea because I see a distressing trend in contemporary discourse that could most generously be described as misappropriated stoicism:

["Fuck your feelings"](https://markmanson.net/fuck-your-feelings)

Author and philosophyer Mark Manson invites his readers to divest themselves of self-indulgence and focus on the question of what is good. This is excellent advice. He warns that self-absorption [(metafeelings)](https://markmanson.net/fuck-your-feelings#metafeelings-table) acts as a barrier to a rational path to self-fulfillment. Moreover, he warns: 

> Much of the social strife that weâ€™re experiencing today is the result of these meta-feelings. Moralizing mobs on both the political right and left see themselves as victimized and somehow special in every miniscule pain or setback they experience. Greed skyrockets while the rich congratulate themselves on being rich in tandem with the increasing rates of [anxiety](https://markmanson.net/videos/overcome-anxiety-course) and depression as the lower and middle classes hate themselves for feeling left behind.

However, the irony and paradox central in the phrase "fuck your feelings" is that it asks you to be indignant about being emotional. Hmm.
