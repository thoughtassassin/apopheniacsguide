description: How did feelings become a dirty word?

What exists?

That is the central question in our discussion of reality.

To be able to examine this question we rely upon how we experience that which exists. The role of the observer is essential to understanding fundamental laws of nature such as quantum mechanics and relativity. The state of particles depends upon the role of the observer. Determining Speed and motion depends upon the position of the observer.

I bring this up to bring you a strangely hopeful message. Your role in the universe is consequential. Your effect is scientifically quantifiable. Each movement that you make sends ripples into the universe.

I lapse into this emotional plea because I see a distressing trend in contemporary discourse that could most generously be described as a malignant brand of stoicism:

["Fuck your feelings"](https://markmanson.net/fuck-your-feelings)

Author and philosopher Mark Manson invites his readers to rid themselves of self-indulgence and focus on the question of what is good. This is excellent advice. He warns that self-absorption [(metafeelings)](https://markmanson.net/fuck-your-feelings#metafeelings-table) acts as a barrier to a rational path to self-fulfillment. Moreover, he warns: 

> Much of the social strife that weâ€™re experiencing today is the result of these meta-feelings. Moralizing mobs on both the political right and left see themselves as victimized and somehow special in every miniscule pain or setback they experience. Greed skyrockets while the rich congratulate themselves on being rich in tandem with the increasing rates of [anxiety](https://markmanson.net/videos/overcome-anxiety-course) and depression as the lower and middle classes hate themselves for feeling left behind.

However, the irony and paradox in the phrase "fuck your feelings" is obvious. A strong emotional reaction to emotion itself is evident. Speaking of metafeelings... ðŸ¤”

Manson's advice is unmistakably in the [stoic tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism). Stoicism begins in the Hellenistic era. An old college philosophy text book that I have says that new philosophical movements (including stoicism) during this time "led people to think primarily of themselves and how they as individuals in a scheme of nature could achieve the most satisfactory personal life." [^1]

The text goes on to provide the historical context for the rise of these philosophical movements:

> These new directions in ethics were brought about to a great extent by the historical conditions of the time. After the Peloponnesian War and with the fall of Athens, Greek civilization declined. With the breakdown of the small Greek city-state, individual citizens lost the sense of the their own importance and their ability to control or perfect thier social and political destiny. Individuals increasingly felt this loss of personal control over collective life as they were absorbed into the growing Roman Empire.

The empowerment that Stoicism provides comes at the cost of turning the locus of control inward. You might not be able to control what is going on in the world but you can control how you respond.
