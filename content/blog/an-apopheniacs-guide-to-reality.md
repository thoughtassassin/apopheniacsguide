title: An Apopheniac's Guide To Reality
description: Uncertainty invites us to investigate our models of reality

Apophenia is defined [as the mistaken perception of *meaningful connections between unrelated things*.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia) Apophenia can be as simple as imagining seeing shapes of animals in clouds. On the other hand the word can also be used to describe disorders like schizophrenia.

Apopheniac is not in the dictionary. I am coining the term to provide a way to describe one who experiences apophenia.

In this blog I explore ideas about cosmology, quantum physics, consciousness, AI, art, cultural theory and philosophy. Each tells us something about how we perceive the world and also about the meaningful connections that we make. Admittedly I am not an expert in any of these subjects. Perhaps the best I can do is provide an entertaining form of apophenia. 

Thank you for taking time to read my blog. I hope you enjoy these subjects as much as I do.
