title: An Apopheniac's Guide To Reality
description: In times so uncertain it is natural to question the nature of reality
---

Apophenia is defined [as the mistaken perception of _meaningful connections between unrelated things_.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia) Apophenia can be as benign as seeing shapes in clouds. At the other end of the spectrum lies disorders like schizophrenia.

Apopheniac is not a real word. I made it up. I am defining an apopheniac is someone who experiences apophenia. In this blog I am taking the role of the apopheniac as I explore ideas about our world ranging from cosmology, quantum physics, consciousness, AI and philosophy.

Thank you for taking time to read my blog. I hope you enjoy these subjects as much as I do.
