title: An Apopheniac's Guide To Reality
description: Uncertainty invites us to investigate our of models of reality

Apophenia is defined [as the mistaken perception of *meaningful connections between unrelated things*.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia) Apophenia can be as benign as seeing shapes in clouds. On the other hand the word can be used to describe disorders like schizophrenia.

Apopheniac is not a real word. I made it up. I define an apopheniac as someone who experiences apophenia. In this blog I take the role of an apopheniac trying to find order and meaning in the world. I explore ideas ranging from cosmology, quantum physics, consciousness, AI, art, cultural theory and philosophy.

Thank you for taking time to read my blog. I hope you enjoy these subjects as much as I do.
